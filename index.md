# Data Description
  My research content is to use computer simulation software to make the mechanical parts meet the movement trajectory required by the movement. It only works on software. In this study, due to the needs of the design that I needed a specific 4-bar rod trajectory to complete the design. Therefore, I will use data experiments to explore the fitting degree of the motion trajectory generated by the data set of the motion coordinates and motion positions of the 4-bar rod and the rod motion trajectory required by the experimental results. I am now designing a mechanical moving part (4bar) It would help to know what the context of this part is. It belongs to the theoretical research part, but it can also be applied in practice. By adjusting the position of the anchor point of each member, and setting the initial coordinates of each rod, I will be able to get a different trajectory of the member. In the repeated data changes, I will continue to correct my movement trajectory by 
inputting different data,and finally fit my required trajectory requirements. I will manually adjust the position of the part through the computer simulation softwarePMKS (Planar Mechanism Kinematic Simulator) mode motion trajectory software, I will get a data set that basically fits the required trajectory, which is a “text” file format, a large amount of data such including “TimeSteps, x_0, y_0, Vx_0, Vy_0, etc.”, and then convert the position image into data output through the simulation software. I think it belongs to open-source software. Finally, by completing the final fitting conditions, the data suffix is ".txt" file.It will generate a standard "TXT" computer file with a size of 99KB.
# Roles and responsibilities
  In thisdata management, my roles are: archiving and preservation; datamanager; datacollection / data generation; data organization; metadata generation; data analysis; DMPimplementation.I am the only person on the team who is developing this research project.•TheDMPoftheexperimentaldataispersonallyinchargeofme.•Sincetherearenootherdatamanagementresponsibilities, itcannotbedefined.•Sincetheprojectisentirelyinperson,thesituationdescribedabovewillnothappen.2. Since this project is purely an individual research project and has not received funding from any institution or other individuals, this research project does not need to consider the legal document requirements that the funder may generate, and does not need to follow any data requirements.3. Bycheckingthewebsite:https://uit.oregonstate.edu/ois/data-management-and-classification-overview.This data can be divided into "UNRESTRICTED" part, and its permission requirements are"This data is intended for general use, and can be found on websites, news releases, and invarious publications. While no harm would befall the university if Unrestricted Informationwere accessed without permission, we are still concerned that the information be presentedunchanged, and be available when needed; as such, there are specific standards of care
Requiredaroundthepresentationofthatinformation".[1]Since my research data is only used for general scientific theoretical research, there is no sensitive material and private personal information, so I categorize my data in the "UNRESTRICTED" part I tend to share data, so I do notthink it needs dataprotection
# Data standards and metadata
  Part1
  No metadata standards were usedfor the documentation of this research project.Thisproject only includes one dataset.Dataset 1:Analog data recording.I usedthe computer simulation software-PMKS (plane mechanism motion simulator)tosimulate movement trajectory. Then I used the datarecording format provided by the software to record the trajectory generated by each simulatedmovement. It formeda prefix name of "KinematicDatafromPMKS”+ “Experiment time”（second + minute + hour + day + month + year) +".CSV" format or a ".TXT" format‘s suffix name file. This file contained the time of the experiment, thedata information of each moment in the experiment, the position information of the x, y coordinate points of the motion trajectory generated by each point in the experiment, the data information of the velocity generated during the movement of each point in the experiment, the motion information of the acceleration,andthe motion information of the angular acceleration.Because multiple experimental data may causeduplicate data in the experiment, in order to determine the order of the experiment, thename of the experimental data file neededto be manually edited.I includedsimplified “experiment name-experiment number-experiment time”to distinguishtherecordfrom theexperimental results.
  Part 2
  My example is the data set generated by my own use of the “PMKS”simulation trajectory experiment,whichis a standard UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) TXT document.“Example-KinematicDatafromPMKS.54.21.17.20.4.2020”
